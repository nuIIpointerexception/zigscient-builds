# Unofficial builds of [Zigscient](https://github.com/llogick/zigscient)

## Is it safe?

This repository is just a [simple GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yml) that builds Zigscient from `main` and publishes a release every night at UTC+0000. (Additionally on push for testing).

See the [official repository](https://github.com/llogick/zigscient) for more details.
